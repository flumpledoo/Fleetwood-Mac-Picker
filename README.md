# Favorite picker

Broadly, this is a tool that allows users to pick certain items from a predefined set over others, repeatedly, until a single favorite is found, and then continue to pick for second place and so on, constructing a list.

This specific implementation allows for ranking of Fleetwood Mac songs. Currently only White Album - Tango are included (Nicks and Buckingham era).

It is adapted from the [Favorite Pok√©mon Picker](https://www.dragonflycave.com/favorite.html).
